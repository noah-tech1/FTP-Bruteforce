# FTP-Bruteforce
This script brute-forces an FTP server by trying passwords from a list. It prompts the user for the server IP, username, password list, and optional log file name. It logs each attempt with a timestamp, notifying the user if a password is found. Use ethically and legally; unauthorized use can lead to serious legal consequences.
